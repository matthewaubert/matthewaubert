# Hi, I'm Matthew Aubert

## About Me

I'm currently working on a career shift into full-stack web development, using <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> curriculum to guide me. Previously I've been a graphic designer and a custom metalworker/blacksmith.

In my personal time I love traveling, hiking and backpacking, landscape and wildlife photography, listening to and playing music, and reading.
